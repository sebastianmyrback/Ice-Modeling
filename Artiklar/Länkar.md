* "Ice dynamics may also have an important role to play in future changes of the GrIS, especially in regions away from the southwest, and the relative contributions of SMB and dynamics to future mass change remain unclear."
* "Nevertheless, new techniques need to be further explored to improve initialization methods using both surface elevation and ice velocity changes, allowing for improved understanding of underlying friction laws and rheological(deformation, viscosity, pressure, etc.) conditions of marine-terminating glaciers (e.g. Gillet-Chaulet et al., 2016; Gillet-Chaulet, 2019)."
- "Given that marine outlet glaciers are especially sensitive to small-change topographic variations, multi-parameter ensemble modelling and the use of novel emulation methods to evaluate uncertainty will become an essential tool in ice-sheet modelling"
- "For example, Bamber et al. (2019) indicate that a high-emissions greenhouse warming scenario gives a not insignificant chance of a total >2 m SLR by 2100."
