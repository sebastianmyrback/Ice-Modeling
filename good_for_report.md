"In order to be able to quantify the convergence of FEM, we need to know higher regularity
of the exact solution (v, ). The availability of higher regularity usually requires that f
belongs to a better space than (Xp). For the remainder of the thesis we therefore assume
that f 2 Lp0(
). Since the available regularity of (v, ) is limited, we restrict ourselves
to the case of low-order finite elements. If not stated otherwise, we consider the case
Xh = Qh = Xh,1." - Hirn p.44

Since Newton’s method requires the existence of first derivatives, for " = 0
its convergence is not ensured in the case 
c 6= ;. Hence, for " = 0 the solution to Problem
(P"
h) cannot (approximatively) be determined by means of Newton’s method in general.
However, if " > 0, it can easily be shown that a" is Gâteaux differentiable on
