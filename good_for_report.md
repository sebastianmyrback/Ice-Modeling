"In order to be able to quantify the convergence of FEM, we need to know higher regularity
of the exact solution (v, ). The availability of higher regularity usually requires that f
belongs to a better space than (Xp). For the remainder of the thesis we therefore assume
that f 2 Lp0(
). Since the available regularity of (v, ) is limited, we restrict ourselves
to the case of low-order finite elements. If not stated otherwise, we consider the case
Xh = Qh = Xh,1." - Hirn p.44
